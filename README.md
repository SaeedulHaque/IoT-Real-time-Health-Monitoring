# IoT-Based Real-Time Patient Health Monitoring System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an **IoT-based real-time patient health monitoring system** that continuously tracks vital health parameters such as **heartbeat, temperature, and blood pressure**. The system utilizes **ESP-32 microcontrollers** to collect sensor data and transmit it to a cloud-based web server for remote access.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of **heartbeat, temperature, and blood pressure**.
- **ESP-32 microcontroller** for efficient sensor data processing and transmission.
- Cloud-based web server for **remote data access and analysis**.
- Secure and reliable data transmission using **MQTT and HTTP protocols**.
- **User-friendly dashboard** for monitoring patient vitals.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: ESP-32 microcontroller, biomedical sensors (heart rate, temperature, BP sensors)
- **Software**: Python, Firebase, Arduino IDE, MQTT protocol
- **Cloud Services**: Google Firebase for data storage and visualization
- **Communication Protocols**: MQTT, HTTP

## System Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Biomedical sensors connected to an **ESP-32** microcontroller collect real-time patient vitals.
2. **Data Transmission**: The ESP-32 transmits sensor data to the cloud using **MQTT or HTTP protocols**.
3. **Cloud Storage**: Google Firebase stores the received data for real-time monitoring and analysis.
4. **User Interface**: A web-based dashboard enables healthcare professionals to track patient vitals remotely.

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- ESP-32 microcontroller
- Arduino IDE installed
- Firebase account setup
- Python environment (for data processing and analysis)

### Steps
1. **Set up the ESP-32**:
   - Install **Arduino IDE** and add the ESP-32 board support package.
   - Upload the firmware code to the ESP-32.
2. **Connect Sensors**:
   - Wire the **heartbeat, temperature, and BP sensors** to the ESP-32.
3. **Configure Firebase**:
   - Set up a **Firebase Realtime Database**.
   - Obtain the **Firebase API credentials** and update them in the ESP-32 firmware.
4. **Run the System**:
   - Power the ESP-32 and check the data being transmitted to Firebase.
   - Use the web dashboard to view real-time patient vitals.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of **AI-based anomaly detection** for critical health alerts.
- Enhanced security features using **encryption protocols**.
- Mobile application for remote monitoring.
